	<p class="text">Barner Christian Academy of Davao City's (BCA) primary goal is character development through the knowledge of Jesus Christ as revealed in the Bible. Stress is placed upon developing the God-given talents and abilities of the child through a program which is committed to maximizing the full potential of each precious child. BCA seeks to provide each child with a Christian education (Proverbs 3:5,6), development of his or her unique skills, and achievement of personal academic excellence.<br><br>
	Since the primary reason for the existence of the school is spiritual in nature, BCA lays a firm foundation for a child to accept Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Savior. (Mark 10:14,15). The child will acquire basic spiritual truths, a spiritually receptive attitude, and an early motivation to make this important decision as he is prompted by the Holy Spirit.<br><br>
	BLC views each child as a special person, a special gift from God (Psalm 127:3). Since we believe in the child, we aim to bring out the fullest potential in him. We have a holistic and Biblical view of the child in developmental perspectives. We provide the conditions and atmosphere wherein the child will grow in wisdom and stature, and in favor wit both God and Man (Luke 2:52).<br><br>
	BLC provides the physical environment wherein the child can explore his body's physical abilities, the way his body fits into space, and the full kinesthetic potential of this body.<br></p>
