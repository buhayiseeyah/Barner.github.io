	<p class="text">Jesus Brings Us Together" was the theme of our 1996 wedding, for God had called both Elvie and I from childhood to be future missionaries. Once married, we planted a church and then reached out to the community through the opening of a much-needed kinderschool. The church now averages 1,300 each Sunday, and the school teaches (through grade 6) over 500 children each day.<br><br>
	Paul M Barner Ministries, Inc (PMBMI) is a federally-recognized American Charitable Organization which we established, designed to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ through planting and strengthening churches across the globe.</p>
