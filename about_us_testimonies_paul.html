		<p class="text">When I was a child, I felt called to be a missionary to the Philippines. While attending summer Bible Camp, I listened to a missionary from the Philippines as he showed his slides from his work in Davao City. It was then, at ten years old, that God called me to missions.<br><br>
		Over the years, I focused on the goal of being a missionary. I attended Bible College and seminary. I became a pastor and was ordained. In 1990, as pastor in New Jersey, I had my first opportunity of visiting the Philippines on a short term missions trip, counseling during an eleven day Christian concert tour. It was awesome. To actually experience the country I'd dreamed about for nearly 2 decades! I was in heaven.<br><br>
		After my return, I continued my ministry in NJ and eventually accepted another pastoral position in Missouri, after two outreach efforts in Washington and Colorado. In 1993, while pastoring in Missouri, one of my members mentioned to me about a second opportunity of visiting the Philippines, through the Rotary club, on a group study exchange program (GSE).<br><br>
		I snatched up the opportunity and the following January was whisked over the ocean once again, but this time for 6 weeks. We toured most of the country, and ended our trip in Davao City. While there, I longed to visit the church which was spoken of by that missionary to Davao 23 years earlier. Two days before our departure from the country, I found the church and visited it with a Baptist missionary.<br><br>
		It was that chance last-minute visit that was to redirect the course of my entire life. For, as the pastor of the Davao church toured me around the building, the curtain to a lecture room was drawn aside, and my eyes caught hold on a beautiful woman teaching a class on prayer.<br><br>
		One thing led to another (yet another story) and we were married two years later. My decision was to remain in the Philippines after the wedding until her visa would be approved by the USA. What was supposed to take four months instead took four years.<br><br>
		Those were God-appointed years. Perhaps the Lord took the papers at the embassy through the hands of an angel, and hid them under the desk, or perhaps a gust from heaven blew the paper under the desk in a dark corner of the embassy.<br><br>
		But during those four years, we started a church, a school, and a foundation to reach the poor and lost in the Philippines for Jesus. Mormons, Catholics, Muslims, Pentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Christians, Buddhists, and other faiths all send their kids to the kinderschool which we built. Today over 100 learn about Jesus each day through the ministry of the Barner Learning Center.<br><br>
		God is good, and supplies the challenges we need to grow in amazing directions through this brief course of life. Our goal? To lead as many as possible to a saving faith in Jesus Christ, so that one day, not only will they be rescued from the clutches of Hell, but that also our God will welcome us home with his, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant. Enter thou into the joy of the Lord."</p>
