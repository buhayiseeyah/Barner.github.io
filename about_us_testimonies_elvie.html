		<p class="subtitle_new">Testimonies- Elvie</p>

		<p class="text">We both felt called, from opposite sides of the ocean. For Elvie, it was when she was in high school, and attending VBS at church. During missions time, she felt God impress upon her heart to go to Hong Kong or Bolivia, but the specific destination was not so clear.<br><br>
		Her Christian parents said that since she was such a good student, the government would pay for her college tuition if she attended government college (same with high school, as it is not free here). They said she should not waste a free education on ministry work. Since a high regard is placed in this country on obedience to parents, even to the extent that you cannot marry a sweetheart if the parents do not like them, she had to comply. She graduated with honors and taught for two years in public school. Yet the call of God was still very strong upon her life.<br><br>
		After the first 6 months of her teaching 6th grade in the rural school, her principal was so impressed with her abilities that he recommended her for teaching in the much larger and better paying city schools. So before that first school year was finished she was transferred, making a good salary. Her parents were pleased, as she bought things for them which they never had had, like a refrigerator and a television set.<br><br>
		Yet inwardly she struggled with the deep heartfelt calling that God had placed upon her heart to be in the ministry. After her second year, she heard that a scholarship was being offered to go to seminary from a businessman in a local church. How she heard of it was not understood, as the scholarship was only for men, not women. She waited at the church all day, to be called upon. But even at the end of the day she was ignored. Then it was that she was told by one of the male applicants that the scholarship was just for men.<br><br>
		She felt bad, but nonetheless the calling upon her still burned from within. So she gave a copy of her application to the young man she'd been talking to, and said, "Sir, if you are accepted, please give these applications to the registrar at the seminary". A few weeks later, a friend spoke to her and said, "Elvie, they just broadcast your name on the Christian radio station! You are to report to the Narra church to pick up your scholarship right away before the team leaves for Zamboanga to school!"<br><br>
		Excited yet confused, she took the jeepney to the church and was informed that the young man had given the application to the secretary of the church instead of bringing it with him to Zamboanga. That morning God had impressed it upon the wealthy businessman's heart to include one female (an unprecedented event in the ten years he'd been sponsoring seminary students), for her seminary degree. She joyfully packed up her belongings and told her parents of her decision.<br><br>
		Her parents were upset. The one child of their ten kids who had the most promise was giving it all up to become a poor person in ministry. Since all the pastors and missionaries they knew were about as poor as the beggars on the street, they figured the same for their daughter. Her father was so crazed by his anger that he threatened suicide, drinking insecticide when she refused to relent. He was rushed to the hospital, yet even to this day one of his eyes is partially blind as a side effect of the poison.<br><br>
		Her brother had said to her, "If papa dies, I will kill you!" In fear she stood her ground, saying, "God, why are you doing this to me? I know that I must go to answer your call upon my life. Yet it is so difficult. Everything is going against me! Nevertheless I trust in you." So she got on the boat and three days later was at the seminary.<br><br>
		Although her tuition and books were subsidized for her seminary training, her food and personal expenses were not. So her youngest sister often sent her allowance to her in the mail. Also her oldest sister occasionally helped. When she received this money in the mail while away at seminary, she would buy a dozen eggs, hard boil them, and then enter the cock pits, where dirty men gamble their paychecks away on rooster fights. <br><br>
		Since these hundreds of men get hungry with all their yelling, Elvie sold the eggs there. One man got so excited that he raised his arms while cheering for his rooster, and knocked over Elvie's tray of hard-boiled eggs. Tears came to her eyes as all the money that came from her sister's allowance. She knew that there was no money left for her to have any dinner that night, nor any for rice for breakfast the next morning.<br><br>
		Then the man who'd hit her made a deal with her. "Pray that my cock wins the fight, and I'll pay you a hundred pesos for your eggs!"The man came true on his promise and paid up after retrieving his winnings. And Elvie ate that night, even supplying some food to her roommates.<br><br>
		Four years later the tears were on the cheeks of her proud parents as Elvie received her Masters Degree in Religious Education, Magna Cum Laude, in Zamboanga. Because of her great merits, she was chosen by the large Narra church to join their staff in charge of youth, children, and evangelism. Two years later I met her when I visited that Davao church, and we were married two years after that, in 1996.</p>
