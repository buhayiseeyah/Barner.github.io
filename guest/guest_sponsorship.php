				<p>International BCA Sponsorships</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>The BCA (Barner Christian Academy of Davao City) International Kinderschool Sponsorship Program is an opportunity for Filipino children who otherwise might not be able to afford a quality Christian education to obtain schooling at no cost to their families through the "adoption" of their financial schooling obligations by international supporters. For support of those at ages 2 through 7, the fee is $25 (P1250) per month in 12 months. <br><br>The school year lasts from June to March in the Philippines. In April we have mandatory Summer School for the sponsored kids. May's sponsorship is a catch-up to make the monthly payments smaller for you. If you did not pay in May, then you'd be paying about $27 a month instead of $25.<br><br>Your $25 covers the following: tuition, enrollment, books, registration, dental checkup, insurance, medical checkup, ID card/jacket, instructional materials, PTA & library & campus fees, school publications, graduation fee & gown, yearbook, field trips, lunches, transportation costs, boy/girl scout membership & uniforms, gym fee, and basic school supplies (notebooks, pencils, etc.)</p>

				<p>Sponsorship Commitments</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>Financial commitments are renewed each April. If you wish to discontinue at the end of the school year, we ask that you inform us before March so that we may transfer your child to another sponsor. If there is no sponsor available for your child, we will not allow that child to enter BCA for the next school year.</p>
